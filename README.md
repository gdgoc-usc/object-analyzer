# Object Analyzer

This repository contains the code for the **Object Analyzer** project developed by **GDG on Campus - University of San Carlos (GDGoC USC)**.

## 💻 Project Branches Overview

This project is structured into two branches to demonstrate the clear separation between a standard web application and one with AI integration:

* **`website-only`**: Contains the foundational code, including the front-end and back-end logic, **without** any AI API calls. This represents the starting point of the workshop.
* **`ai-integrated`**: Contains the final, complete project where the **Gemini API** has been successfully integrated to add object analysis functionality.

## ⚠️ Educational Focus & Security Warning

This project is strictly **for educational purposes** to teach the fundamentals of **AI integration** using the Gemini API.

**CRITICAL SECURITY ALERT:** **DO NOT DEPLOY** this project with your API key hardcoded in the files. Hardcoding secrets is a major security risk. For any production use, you must always use secure methods like **Environment Variables** or a dedicated **Secret Manager**.

## 🗝️ How to Get a Gemini API Key

To run the AI-integrated branch of this project, you will need a **Gemini API Key**.

1.  **Visit Google AI Studio:** Navigate to the official Google AI Studio page.
2.  **Sign In:** Log in with your Google Account.
3.  **Generate Key:** On the API Key dashboard, click the button to **"Create API Key."**
4.  **Secure Your Key:** The generated key is your credential. Copy it and save it securely. You should then set it as an **environment variable** named `GEMINI_API_KEY` on your machine, rather than pasting it directly into the code.
